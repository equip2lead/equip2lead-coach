## 2026-09-07 — Phase 5.3 Coach's Office dashboard

Complete redesign of /dashboard shipped to app.equip2lead.coach.

Six blocks: greeting, next step, what you've written, module grid, pillars, closing quote.
Denis's voice throughout. No gamification.
State-aware greeting variants (6 states, 3-4 copy variants each, day-of-year rotation).
Assessment vs Sequential mode toggle (profiles.next_step_mode column).
Module grid with pillar and status filters, URL persistence.
Read/Revise routing via ?view=submission and ?view=edit.
Draft integrity rules: newer beats submission, older shows banner, none creates from submission.

Fixed: PostgREST zero-row DELETE silent-success. Delete now .select()s and errors explicitly.

Old dashboard archived as _dashboard-legacy.tsx.

Migrations in production:
- profiles.next_step_mode TEXT DEFAULT 'assessment' CHECK IN ('assessment', 'sequential')

## 2026-09-08 — Module 2 "Character in the Dark"

Live at app.equip2lead.coach. Data-only ship — no code change, no deploy.

lesson_modules id 8fb09718-38c0-4978-abf4-93a1ca95c1af, slug character-in-the-dark.
181 blocks, 8 sections, module_number 2, sort_order 2, is_starting_point false.
Pillar: Personal Leadership. Difficulty: foundation -> beginner. Duration: 90 min.

Blocks: paragraph 84, heading 32, callout 31, divider 15, reflection_questions 6,
table 6, pull_quote_card 5, video_embed 1, assignment_prompt 1 (assignment_key a1,
4 prompts, 200-600 words).

Verified in production: all 8 sections render with correct titles, the Brené Brown
embed loads (youtube-nocookie/iCvmsMzlF7o, confirmed not restricted), the Section 8
assignment form loads with textarea and word counter, and the dashboard grid shows
Module 2 beside Module 0 and Module 1.

Ingestion integrity: body_blocks had to be appended in 21 chunks because the SQL
transport rejected payloads above ~3KB. Verified afterwards by md5 of the jsonb
canonical form against the locally transformed file — exact match, 181/181 distinct
block ids.

knowledge_documents sources used (read-only, unmodified):
- 18c8d987 Leadership Character — Charisma vs Character, Leader Preparation (all 6 chapters, now fully spent)
- b105f64c Never Give Up — Perseverance, Resilience and Personal Transformation (now fully spent)
- 265a1995 / fcc7de5d FIRE Bible Institute — Spiritual Leadership Curriculum + Syllabus
- e4dbc9b1 Leadership Development 2.0 — Trust, Integrity, Teamwork and Conflict
Plus external web-verified citations (Maxwell, Covey, Kouzes & Posner, US Army ADP 6-22,
Munroe, Brown) — see MODULE_2_FINAL.md for the full provenance tracker.

Pending assets, shipped visible as placeholder callouts, not faked:
- 2 videos pending recording (module intro; Section 5 "Before We Go Further")
- 6 images pending generation (Sections 1, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8)

Not done, awaiting decision:
- plan_data week link. Week 1 -> Module 1 was already linked (5.2e complete). Weeks 2-12
  are open, but Week 2's AI-generated theme is "Confronting the Legacy You Are Currently
  Building" / focus Multiplication & Impact, which does not match a character module.
  Week 8 ("Turning Self-Awareness Into Consistent Leadership Practice", focus Personal
  Leadership) is the better thematic fit. Not written either way.
