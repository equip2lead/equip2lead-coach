## 2026-09-07 — Phase 5.3 Coach's Office dashboard

Complete redesign of /dashboard shipped to app.equip2lead.coach.

Six blocks: greeting, next step, what you've written, module grid, pillars, closing quote.
Denis's voice throughout. No gamification.
State-aware greeting variants (6 states, 3-4 copy variants each, day-of-year rotation).
Assessment vs Sequential mode toggle (profiles.next_step_mode column).
Module grid with pillar and status filters, URL persistence.
Read/Revise routing via ?view=submission and ?view=edit.
Draft integrity rules: newer beats submission, older shows banner, none creates from submission.

Fixed: PostgREST zero-row DELETE silent-success. Delete now .select()s and errors explicitly.

Old dashboard archived as _dashboard-legacy.tsx.

Migrations in production:
- profiles.next_step_mode TEXT DEFAULT 'assessment' CHECK IN ('assessment', 'sequential')
